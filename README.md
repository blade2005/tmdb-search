# tmdb-search
This project is to have a simple interface to interact with the themoviedb.org API and make searches for actors or movies and return the data.

This is a alpha project so far and any contribution is appreaciated.

For the API interaction I am making use of existing project by pixelead0, https://github.com/pixelead0/tmdb_v3-PHP-API-/

I have trimmed out unnecessary code for this purpose.
